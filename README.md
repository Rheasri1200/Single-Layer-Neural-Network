# Single-Layer-Neural-Network
Planar Data Classifiacation with a hidden layer

This is a neural network model, which will have a hidden layer. There will be huge difference between this model and the one you implemented using logistic regression.Because logistic Regression gives accuracy of about 67% but with single layer Neural Nets it gives an accuracy of about 90%.This dataset consists "flower" with some red (label y=0) and some blue (y=1) points. The goal is to build a model to fit this data. In other words,  classify to define regions as either red or blue.
